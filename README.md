# BirdNET file Processing

Take files like these and combine them into a single file:
- EARTH_20220809_025600.BirdNET.results.csv
- EARTH_20220812_072100.BirdNET.results.csv

These files are created originally via a bird sound recorder. These are then processed with BirdNET to identify birds.
To make them more useful and easier to explore the data they are then combined into a single file.
